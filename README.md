# Daily.Dev Bookmarks to Twitter

## A Weekly Tweet to share your last week's bookmarks automatically!

### ðŸŽ‰ Runners-up in Daily.dev Hackathon

I have integrated new feature of sharing bookmarks in daily.dev with Twitter. <br>
Here one has to just copy and paste the link of his sharable bookmarks. <br>
And then just pick up a time of the week where a tweet will be sent with those bookmark links!

This type of integration can be done to many platforms where on a scheduled time, the bookmarks will be shared with everyone of your followers.!

This can be just one of the ways of integrating daily.dev RSS feed.!
